# Development Progress

This document tracks my development process and commit history for the expense tracker project.

## Development Approach

I followed an incremental development approach, building features step by step and testing each component before moving to the next.

## Commit History

### Initial Setup
- Set up project structure with separate backend and frontend
- Configured Prisma with SQLite for development
- Added basic Express server with security middleware

### Authentication System
- Implemented user registration with password validation
- Added login system with JWT tokens
- Built refresh token mechanism for security
- Created protected route middleware

### Expense Management
- Designed expense data model with categories
- Built CRUD API endpoints for expenses
- Added automatic tax calculation logic
- Implemented user data isolation

### Frontend Development
- Set up React with Vite for fast development
- Created authentication pages with form validation
- Built dashboard with expense listing
- Added filtering and search functionality

### Advanced Features
- Implemented pagination for large datasets
- Added sorting by different criteria
- Built responsive design for mobile devices
- Created detailed expense view pages

### Testing and Documentation
- Added comprehensive test coverage
- Created API documentation
- Built deployment configurations
- Finalized project documentation

## Key Decisions Made

1. **SQLite for Development**: Chose SQLite for easy local development
2. **JWT Authentication**: Implemented secure token-based auth
3. **Prisma ORM**: Used for type-safe database operations
4. **React Hooks**: Modern React patterns throughout
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

## Challenges Overcome

- Database enum compatibility with SQLite
- Token refresh mechanism implementation
- Real-time calculation updates in forms
- Responsive table design for mobile devices

This project demonstrates full-stack development skills with modern technologies and best practices.
